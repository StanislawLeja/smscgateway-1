	<title>Routing Rules</title>
	<para>
	&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can now act as a SMPP Server accepting incoming SMPP connections or can also act as a SMPP client initiating a connection to a remote SMSC server. Therefore you can now set an intelligent routing rule to route SMS between SMPP connections or between SMPP and GSM.
	</para>
	<para>
By default, &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is setup to leverage the "address-range" to decide the routing of SMS. For example:
	</para>
	<para>
1) If Server ESME is defined of type RECEIVER (and hence accepts incoming RECEIVER BIND from peer client) with address range as 6666; if SMS arrives in system destined for 6666, it matches with this ESME and SMS will be sent as DELIVER_SM to client side. 
	</para>
	<para>
2) If Client ESME is defined of type TRANSMITTER (and hence initiates TRANSMITTER BIND to peer server) with address range as 6666; if SMS arrives in system destined for 6666, it matches with this ESME and SMS will be sent as SUBMIT_SM to server side.
	</para>
	<para>
The destined number of SMS is checked with address range. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; uses regular expression for matching the pattern.
	</para>
	<para>
The above methodology can work if the routing rule is based on MSISDN range, however if the range is not fixed (like in case of Number Portability) the above process will break. In such cases you can define a Database routing rule. You must change the value of the property <literal>smsRoutingRuleClass</literal> in the file <filename>Telscale-smscgateway-&lt;version&gt;/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/deploy/telscale-smsc-server/META-INF/jboss-beans.xml</filename> to look like below and un-comment if its commented out:
<screen><![CDATA[
<property name="smsRoutingRuleClass">org.mobicents.smsc.smpp.DatabaseSmsRoutingRule</property> 
]]>
</screen>
SMSC stores the routing rule in the Cassandra Database. You can populate this table with address and corresponding cluster name as explained in the sections below.

<screen><![CDATA[
Name
	smsc databaserule update

SYNOPSIS
	smsc databaserule update <address> <systemId> <SMPP|SIP> networkid <networkId>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to add or update a Database Rule for SMPP or SIP. 

	The parameter <SMPP|SIP> is used to define if the rule is for SMPP or SIP. This 
	is an optional parameter and if unspecified, by default the rule is set for SMPP.
 	
	Database Rules are Rules that are used for routing messages to a proper ESME. 
	When you define a rule using the above command, you are creating a routing rule
	that states:
	"If the destination address of a message corresponds with the value specified in
	the 'address' field, then the message be sent to an ESME identified by the value
	specified in the 'systemId' field".

	To add a new rule you must issue the command with the systemId parameter and
	specify if the rule is for SIP or SMPP.

	To update an existing rule, you must issue the command with both the address 
	parameter and the systemId parameter and specifiy if the rule is for SIP or SMPP.

	networkId - means to which virtual SS7 subnetwork belongs a database
	            routing rule (this is for Multi-tenancy support). If this
	            parameter is skipped - networkId will be set to "0" for
	            a database routing rule operation.

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to delete an existing Database Rule specified for 'address'.

	The parameter <SMPP|SIP> is used to define if the rule is deleted for SMPP or SIP. 
	This is an optional parameter and if unspecified, by default the rule is 
	deleted for SMPP.
