Name
	smsc stat get

SYNOPSIS
	smsc stat get 

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to view the details of the current state of the SMSC and
	monitor the SMSC. The output prints the following parameters:

	Time			- Current time. By obtaining this statistic twice, this 
				  value can be used to calculate the time interval between
				  statistic time.

	MessageInProcess	- Number of messages currently being processed for 
				  delivery in GSM (MT messages) and SMPP (messages that
				  are routed to ESME).

	MessageId		- This is the last assigned Message Id. This indicates
				  the number of messages that have come into the SMSC
				  from GSM (Mobile Originated messages) or from ESMEs and
				  and stored in the Cassandra database. The MessageId 
				  counter is initiated from the time of the installation
				  of the SMSC.

	MessageScheduledTotal	- The number of messages put into the delivering process
				  in both GSM and SMPP since the SMSC was started.

	DueSlotProcessingLag	- The time (in seconds) between "in time" due_slot and 
				  "in process" due_slot. 

				  If this value is equal to 0 or 1 or 2, it means that the
				  SMSC is not highly loaded and all the messages are 
				  being processed on time. 

				  If this value is high, say for example 300, then it 
				  means the SMSC is overloaded and is now processing 
				  messages, that are scheduled for processing 300 seconds 
				  before the current time. 

				  If this value is progressively increasing, then the SMSC
				  is heavily overloaded and the incoming messages count at
				  SMPP (and MO) are more than what the SMSC can deliver.
				  
				  If the incoming messages are not many, this value will
				  decrease and will reach 0 when there are no messages.

				  Normally this value will return to 0 except for few
				  peaks. If it does not, then you must reduce the load for
				  SMSC.
	
	Param1			- Ignore.

	Param2			- Ignore.
	
	SmscStartTime		- The time when the SMSC was started.
