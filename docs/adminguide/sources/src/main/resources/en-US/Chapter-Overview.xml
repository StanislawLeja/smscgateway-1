            <title>SMSC Gateway</title>
            <para>SMSC (Short Message Service Center) is a telecommunications network facility responsible for handling the SMS operations of a wireless network. When a subscriber sends an SMS message from a mobile phone, the message first reaches the SMS Center which then forwards the message to the desired destination. The SMS Center is responsible for routing the SMS messages and regulating the process. If the recipient is not reachable (the phone is switched off or out of coverage area etc.) the SMS Center will store the message to a database and forward it to the recipient when available. Messages that are delivered successfully and messages that failed to be delivered are stored in an archive database for logging purposes.</para>

            <itemizedlist> 
				<listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; can handle mobile originated SMS and deliver them to the intended recipient (mobile, ESME or SIP).
				It also provides a flexible routing mechanism to route messages to/from ESME over SMPP protocol. It can also act as ESME initiating connection to third party SMSC.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports SIP connection through JSLEE SIP RA.</para></listitem>
                <listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports StoreAndForward, Datagramm and Transactional modes (and also special ForwardAndStrore mode for reducing of database load)
for incoming from SMPP ESME messages. When a message comes from SMPP SMSC GW checks EsmClass field from the SMPP message. For Datagramm and Transactional modes
the SMSC will try to deliver immediately the message into a destination. For Transactional mode SMSC also returns to ESME a delivery result (success / failure).
Such messages are not stored into a cassandra database.
When delivery failure the message will be dropped and no more delivery attempts will be made.
If EsmClass field contains StoreAndForward (or default) mode it is possible of several attempts of message delivering (if the first attempt has failed).
For this purpose a message can be stored into a cassandra database.
There are two possible SMSC configurable modes for processing of StoreAndForward messages: StoreAndForward (normal) and ForwardAndStore (fast).
When StoreAndForward (normal) SMSC mode an incomimg "StoreAndForward" message will be always stored into a database and then (in some seconds) will be scheduled for delivering.
This mode is fully compliant with SMPP specification. When ForwardAndStore (fast) SMSC mode an incomimg "StoreAndForward" message will be immidiately tried to deliver 
without database storing and any delay. When delivery failure the message will be stored into a database for futher scheduling.</para></listitem> 
                <listitem><para>Messages that come from SS7 or SIP are processed the same way as "StoreAndForward" messages that come from SMPP ESME</para></listitem> 
                <listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; SMSC GW has a congestion control by rejecting messages when a count of message in processing exceeds a configurable limit (MaxActivityCount).
When SMSC is configured in ForwardAndStore (fast) mode SMPP originated messages will be firstly rejected,
then after encreasing of a message in processing count SIP originated messages will be rejected
and finally SS7 originated messages will be rejected. When SMSC is configured in StoreAndForward (normal) mode only datagramm and transactional SMPP originated messages
will be rejected. StoreAndForward and all SS7 / SIP originated messages will be stored into cassandra database in any case but scheduling of messages for delivering will be
stopped till a message in processing count will not exceed the limit.</para></listitem> 
                <listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports ReportSMDeliveryStatus and AlertServiceCentre requests after mobile delivery failures.</para></listitem> 
                <listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports GSM7, GSM8 and UCS2 message encodings.</para></listitem>

				<listitem><para>Additionally, when enabled with proper administrator privileges, &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; allows convenient group messaging <footnoteref linkend='fnrestcomm'/>between subscribers (e.g. family, friends, colleagues) .</para></listitem> 
				<!--<listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; offers “SMS Broadcasting” which enables marketing campaigns. Via
convenient Web UI, campaign administrators can prioritize, schedule and monitor a

instances for faster SMS delivery to all intended recipients.</para></listitem> -->

				<listitem><para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is built on the TelScale jSS7 stack which provides advanced SCCP routing

A single &THIS.PLATFORM; SMSC node can process up to 1000 SMS/sec. Multiple SMSC nodes can be arranged in a cluster across one or more geographically distributed data centers to scale up throughput and provide various levels of redundancy, high availability and fault tolerance.

				IP Short Message Gateway (IP-SM-GW), which is in line with relevant 3GPP 23.824 specifications, acts as a bridge, managing the origination and termination of SMS messages between circuit-switched and IP-based networks (over SIP). With the solution, mobile operators can use existing messaging platforms such as short message service centers
				(SMSCs) deliver IP-based messaging. The IP-SM-GW is also essential for rolling out rich communication services (RCS), which enable operators to deliver sticky messaging
				services like presence-enabled address book, SIP-based chat services and mobile instant messaging.

				TelScale SMSC has support for SIP messagaing and can send short messages from SIP to SS7 or ESME and vice-a-versa. TelScale SMSC can easily be integarted with TelScale RestComm via SIP to enable developers to rapidly build voice, video, WebRTC, USSD, SMS, fax and rich messaging applications. More details about RestComm can be obtained from <ulink url="http://www.telestax.com/restcomm/">here</ulink>
