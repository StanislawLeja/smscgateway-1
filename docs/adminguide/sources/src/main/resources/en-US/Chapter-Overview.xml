	  <para>
    	SS7 (Signalling System No.7) is a set of signaling protocols defined for information exchange in telephony. It is the global standard for telecommunications and is defined by the <ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/ITU">International Telecommunication Union (ITU) - Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)</ulink>. It is also commonly referred to as Common Channel Signaling System No. 7 (i.e., <acronym>SS7</acronym> or <acronym>C7</acronym>).
		</para>
		<para>
		In telephony (wireless and wireline), the information associated with a call must be exchanged between a telephone and the telephone exchange or between exchanges, transit nodes and other elements in the network. Information exchange is required to set up, control and tear down calls and this exchange of information is called Signaling. SS7 is the global standard that defines the procedures and protocol to be followed by network elements in the Public Switched Telephone Network (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>) in order to exchange information over a digital signaling network to effect wireless (cellular) and wireline call setup, route,control, monitor and terminate. 
		</para>
	<para>
		The
		ITU definition of SS7 allows for national variants such as the
		American National Standards Institute (<acronym>ANSI</acronym>) and Bell Communications
		Research (Telcordia Technologies) standards used in North America and
		the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (
		<ulink url="http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/ETSI">ETSI</ulink>
		) standard
		used in Europe.
	</para>
	
	<para>
		The hardware and software functions of the <acronym>SS7</acronym> protocol are divided
		into
		functional abstractions called "levels". These levels map loosely
		to
		the Open Systems Interconnect (<acronym>OSI</acronym>) 7-layer model defined by the
		<ulink url="http://www.iso.ch/">International Standards Organization (ISO)</ulink>.

		<title>Time Division Multiplexing</title>
		<para>
			In circuit switched networks such as the Public Switched Telephone
			Network (<acronym>PSTN</acronym>) there exists the need to transmit multiple
			subscribers’ calls along the same transmission medium. To accomplish
			this, network designers make use of Time Division Multiplexing<acronym>TDM</acronym>. <acronym>TDM</acronym> allows switches to
			create channels, also known as tributaries, within a transmission
			stream. A standard DS0 voice signal has a data bit rate of 64 kbit/s,
			determined using Nyquist’s sampling criterion. <acronym>TDM</acronym> takes frames of
			the voice signals and multiplexes them into a <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame which runs at
			a higher bandwidth. So if the <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame consists of 'n' voice frames,
			the bandwidth will be n*64 kbit/s.
			Each voice sample timeslot in the <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame is called a channel . In
			European systems, <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames contain 30 digital voice channels, and
			in American systems, they contain 24 channels. Both standards also
			contain extra bits (or bit timeslots) for signalling (SS7) and
			synchronisation bits.
			Multiplexing more than 24 or 30 digital voice channels is called higher order
			multiplexing. Higher order multiplexing is accomplished by
			multiplexing the standard <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames.For example, a European 120
			channel <acronym>TDM</acronym> frame is formed by multiplexing four standard 30 channel
			<acronym>TDM</acronym> frames.At each higher order multiplex, four <acronym>TDM</acronym> frames from the
			immediate lower order are combined, creating multiplexes with a
			bandwidth of n x 64 kbit/s, where n = 120, 480, 1920, etc.
