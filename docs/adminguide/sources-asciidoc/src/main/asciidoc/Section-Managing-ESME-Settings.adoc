= External Short Messaging Entities (ESMEs)

&THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;can now act as ESME (initiate bind to remote SMSC) or can also act as SMSC (accept bind from remote ESME). While defining an ESME (SMPP connection), you can optionally pass the Cluster name.
If it is not passed, cluster name is same as ESME name.
As the name suggests, its now possible to group different ESMEs in the same cluster.
This is useful only when SMS is suppose to be routed out of &THIS.PLATFORM;&THIS.APPLICATION;to ESME.
If there are multiple ESME's in a cluster, the load is shared in a round robin fashion to send out SMS.
In case if one of the ESME is in `UNBOUND` state, the next `BOUND` smpp connection (within same cluster) will be used.
Below diagram explains the load-balancing between SMPP connections  

.SMPP Load Balancing
image::images/smsc-SMPP-Loadbalancing.png[] 			 

You can define multiple ESMEs, each with a unique name but the same `systemId` and declare their `host-ip` and `port` values as -1 (only for SMPP type Server). The SMSC will now accept multiple incoming BIND requests from any `IP` and any `port` as far as the `systemId` and `Password` matches.
 

Alternatively, if you declare a real value for `host-ip`(say for example 10.199.7.23) and `port` as -1, the SMSC will accept as many BINDS as ESMEs defined from the specified IP but any port as far as the `systemId` and `Password` matches.

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to configure a new ESME.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	Name			- A unique name for this ESME configuration. You can 
				  define as many ESMEs as you want as far as the name is 
				  unique and the combination of 
				  SystemId:host-ip:port:SmppBindType is unique.

	System Id		- This is used to identify an ESME or an SMSC at bind 
				  time. An 'ESME system_id' identifies the ESME or ESME 
				  agent to the SMSC. The 'SMSC system_id' provides an 
				  identification of the SMSC to the ESME. You can define 
				  multiple ESMEs, each with a unique name but the same 
				  <literal>systemId<literal> to allow anonymous incoming
				  binds and multiple binds from the same IP depending on
				  the values specified for host-ip and port.

	host-ip	& port		- If the SMSC is acting as an ESME, the BIND request will 
				  be sent to the configured IP and Port. If the SMSC is 
				  acting as a Server, it will accept incoming BIND 
				  requests from the specified IP and Port. 
				  If the port is unknown, you must pass '-1' as wild 
				  character.

				  When you define multiple ESMEs with the same systemId,if
				  host-ip and port values are -1 (for SMPP type Server), 
				  the SMSC will accept multiple incoming BIND requests
			          from any IP:port as long as the systemId and password
				  match. 

				  When you define multiple ESMEs with the same systemId,if
				  host-ip is a real value (a specific IP) and port value 
				  is -1, the SMSC will accept as many BINDS as ESMEs 
				  defined from the specified IP but any port as long as 
				  the systemId and password match. 

	SmppBindType 		- Possible values: TRANSCEIVER, TRANSMITTER or RECEIVER. 
				  If the SMSC is acting as an ESME, it will initiate 
				  corresponding bind. If the SMSC is acting as a Server,
				  it will accept corresponding bind from a remote ESME.

	SmppSession.Type 	- Possible values: SERVER or CLIENT. 
				  If the value is 'SERVER', the SMSC acts as a Server 
				  listening for incoming SMPP binds. 
				  If the value is 'CLIENT', the SMSC will initiate 
				  SMPP bind to a remote Server.

	Optional Parameters
	
	Password		- It is used by the SMSC to authenticate the identity of 
				  the binding ESME. The Service Provider may require 
				  ESMEâ€™s to provide a password when binding to the SMSC.	

	networkId       - indicates virtual subnetwork that this ESME belongs. SMS 
	                flows within same netwrokId, unless changed using mproc
	                (this is for multi-tenancy support). If this parameter is
                    skipped - networkId will be set to "0" when ESME creation.
                    If you do not use multi-tenancy support - set this value
                    to 0 or skip.   			  

	system-type 		- Default value is null. 
				  This is used to categorize the type of ESME that is 
				  binding to the SMSC.

	interface-version	- Default value is 3.4. 

				  It is used to indicate the version of the SMPP protocol.

				  It is set in 'SMPPServer Settings'. 

	esme-ton 		- Defines ESME TON. If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this TON will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same TON as configured here. If the configured 
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

	esme-npi 		- Defines ESME NPI. If the SMPP Session Type is CLIENT,
				  this NPI will be used in the BIND request. If the SMPP
				  Session Type is SERVER, the incoming BIND request should
				  have the same NPI as configured here. If the configured 
				  value is null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.		

	esme-range 		- Defines ESME Address Range. If the SMPP Session Type is 
				  CLIENT, this Address Range will be used in the BIND 
				  request. If the SMPP Session Type is SERVER, the 
				  incoming BIND request should have the same Address Range
				  as configured here. If the configured value is 
				  null (-1), SMSC will ignore it in both cases.

	cluster-name 		- If it is not specified then its same as the name. 
				  It is possible to group different SMPP connections 
				  together by specifying the same cluster-name. 
				  All the SMPP connection's that are capable of sending 
				  out SMS are candidates for grouping.

	window-size 		- Default value is 1. 
				  The window size is the amount of unacknowledged requests
				  that are permitted to be outstanding/unacknowledged at 
				  any given time. If more requests are added, the 
				  underlying stack will throw an exception.

				  This value is set only when ESME is defined as Client 
				  side. For Server side this value is taken from the 
				  'SMPP Server Settings'.
	  
	connect-timeout		- Default value is 10000 milli seconds. 
				  This parameter is used to specify the time within which 
				  the connection to a remote SMSC server should be 
				  established.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	request-expiry-timeout	- Default value is -1 (disabled). 
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait in 
				  milli seconds for an endpoint to respond to before it 
				  expires.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	client-bind-timeout  - Default value is 5000 milli seconds.
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait in
				  milli seconds for an ESME client bind to a SMPP
				  server.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	window-monitor-interval	- Default value is -1 (disabled).
				  This parameter is used to specify the time between 
				  executions of monitoring the window for requests that 
				  expire. It is recommended that this value, generally, 
				  either matches or is half the value of 
				  'request-expiry-timeout'. Therefore, in the worst case
				  scenario, a request could take upto 1.5 times the 
				  'requestExpiryTimeout' to clear out.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	window-wait-timeout 	- Default value is 60000 milli seconds. 
				  This parameter is used to specify the time to wait 
				  until a slot opens up in the 'sendWindow'.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	counters-enabled 	- Default value is true. 
				  When this is enabled, SMSC exposes the statistics for
				  SMPP connections.

				  This is useful only when ESME is defined as Client Side. 
				  For Server side this value is taken from the
				  the 'SMPP Server Settings'.

	enquire-link-delay	- Default value is 30000 milli seconds. 
				  When SMSC connects to a remote server as CLIENT, it 
				  sends an 'ENQUIRE_LINK' after every configured 
				  enquire-link-delay.

	enquire-link-delay-server - Default value is 0 milli seconds. 
				  When SMSC connects to a remote server as SERVER, it 
				  sends an 'ENQUIRE_LINK' after every configured 
				  enquire-link-delay-server.

	charging-enabled	- Flag to enable or disable charging for every SMS 
				  arriving from SIP.

	source-ton		- Every SMS coming into the SMSC via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_ton' as the value configured here.

				  If this configured value is null(-1) or not null and 
				  matches, the SMSC will compare the
				  'source_addr_npi' and 'source_addr_range' as explained 
				  below. 

				  If it doesn't match, the SMSC will reject this SMS with 
				  an error code '0x0000000A' indicating 
				  Invalid Source Address.

	source-npi		- Every SMS coming into the SMSC via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_npi' as the value configured here.
				  configured here. 

				  If this configured value is null(-1)
				  or not null and matches, the SMSC will compare the 
				  'source_addr_range' as below. 

				  If it doesn't match, the SMSC will reject this 
				  SMS with an error code '0x0000000A' indicating 
				  Invalid Source Address.

	source-range		- Every SMS coming into the SMSC via this ESME should have
				  the same 'source_addr_range' as the value configured 
				  here.This is a regular java expression and 
				  default value is ^[0-9a-zA-Z]*. 

				  If it matches, the SMSC will accept the incoming SMS 
				  and process further.

				  If it doesn't match, the SMSC will reject this 
				  SMS with an error code '0x0000000A' indicating 
				  Invalid Source Address.

	routing-ton		- The DefaultSmsRoutingRule will try to match the 
				  'dest_addr_ton' of outgoing SMS with the value 
				  configured here. If this configured value is null(-1) 
				  or not null and matches, the SMSC will compare the
				  'dest_addr_npi' and 'destination_addr' as explained 
				  below. If it doesn't match, the SMSC will select the 
				  next ESME in the list for matching routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing 
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
				  2) SmppBindType is RECEIVER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is SERVER
				  3) SmppBindType is TRANSMITTER and 
				  SmppSession.Type is CLIENT

				  'destination_addr' of outgoing SMS with the value
				  configured here. This is a regular java expression and 
				  default value is ^[0-9a-zA-Z]*. If it matches, the SMSC
				  will send the SMS out over this SMPP connection. If it 
				  doesn't match, the SMSC will select the next ESME in 
				  the list for matching routing rule.

				  DefaultSmsRoutingRule will consider ESME for routing 
				  only if
				  1) SmppBindType is TRANSCEIVER
