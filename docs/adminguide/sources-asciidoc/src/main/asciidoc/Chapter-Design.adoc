= Architecture

{this-platform} {this-application} is based on robust and proven {this-platform} JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server and {this-platform} jSS7 Stack and provides easy integration with any third party communication protocol and platform. 

{this-platform} JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment.
It provides a set of connectors to a variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, TCAP, INAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others.
It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1). 

{this-platform} jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol.
It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. {this-platform} jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled within and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack. 

The diagram below depicts a high level design of {this-platform} {this-application} .


image::images/smsc-application-design-overview.png[]

{this-platform} {this-application} provides 8 basic services of an SMSC as shown in the figure above.
Each of these 8 services are implemented in the Gateway as a module that can be activated or deactivated based on the needs of an operator.
All these services interact with the Cassandra database for storing data (messages not yet sent and an archive for sent/failed to send messages) and retreiving data for messages that are pending to be sent. 

{this-platform} {this-application} can accept SMPP (incoming BIND) from ESMEs or can also initiate SMPP (outgoing BIND) to third party SMSC and hence itself acting as an ESME. {this-platform} {this-application} provides intelligent routing rules that can route SMS between various SMPP connections or between SMPP, GSM and SIP Network. 



.Service Modules
Mo (Mobile originated) module::
  Receives mobile originated SMS via MO procedure for further delivering.

Hr (Home routing) module::
  Receives mobile originated SMS via HR (Home routing) procedure for further delivering.

Tx SMPP module::
  Receives incoming SMS from ESME/third party via SMPP protocol for further delivering.

Tx SIP module::
  Receives incoming SMS from SIP Client and routes them for further delivering.

Tx HTTP module::
  Receives incoming SMS from HTTP connector and routes them for further delivering.

Mt (Mobile terminated)::
  Delivers SMS to mobile via MT procedure.

Rx SMPP module::
  Delivers SMS to external ESME/third party SMSC.

Rx SIP module::
  Delivers SMS to SIP Client received.

.Administration
CLI::
  {this-platform} {this-application} comes with a Command Line Interface (CLI) that provides easy to use commands to manage and monitor the SS7 Stack and the SMSC Gateway. 

Web Interface::
  {this-platform} {this-application} also includes an easy to use Web Interface administration tool that allows you to manage and monitor the Gateway via a convenient Web console. 

Campaign Tool::
  In addition, future releases will also offer a Web based campaign tool to define and manage campaigns. | 

== Database Table Structure

{this-platform} {this-application} stores messages using Cassandra database. The database is used for storing:

* unsent messages, messages successfully sent and messages that failed to be sent
* referenses to sent messages depending on local and remote SMSC messageId
* some service info needed for SMSC GW functionality

The {this-platform} {this-application} creates all database tables itself. A user have to create only an empty keyspace for them. Default keyspace name is "RestCommSMSC".

The {this-platform} {this-application} creates tables for every new day with the date suffixed to the names of the tables as `DST_SLOT_TABLE_yyyy_mm_dd`, `SLOT_MESSAGES_TABLE_yyyy_mm_dd`, `MESSAGES_yyyy_mm_dd`, `MES_ID_YYYY_MM_DD` and `DLV_MES_ID_YYYY_MM_DD` where `yyyy_mm_dd` is the date in that format.

Apart from the above tables created everyday, the database also comprises of three other tables namely `CURRENT_SLOT_TABLE`, `SMPP_SMS_ROUTING_RULE_2` and `SIP_SMS_ROUTING_RULE_2` created when the SMSC is started for the first time.
The firts one is used for storing system-wide data and the latter two for storing the routing rules.

=== Reporting

As of now there is no reporting in {this-platform} {this-application} .
However you can leverage any external third party tool to dig Cassandra tables as defined above and create reports.
The next release of {this-platform} {this-application} will feature a reporting section and also the flexibility to search for a specific SMS based on various search criteria.
