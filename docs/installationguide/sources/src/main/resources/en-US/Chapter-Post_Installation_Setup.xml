		<para>
			You must ensure that you configure the database correctly before using the &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; in production. Cassandra has the concept of a keyspace, which is similar to a database in a RDBMS. You must create a keyspace by following the instructions in the procedure below:</para> 
		<procedure>
			<title>Create a Cassandra database (keyspace)</title>
			<step><para>
			You must have the database running prior to creating the keyspace. For instructions on how to run Cassandra, please refer to the vendor documentation available in their website <ulink url="http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/GettingStarted"></ulink>.
<screen><![CDATA[
[vinu@vinu-neha]$ cd $CASSANDRA_HOME
[vinu@vinu-neha cassandra]$ ./bin/cassandra -f
]]>
</screen>    
			</para></step>
			<step><para>
			When you have the database running successfully, you can proceed to creating the keyspace by making use of the cql command as below:
<screen><![CDATA[
[vinu@vinu-neha]$ CREATE KEYSPACE "TelestaxSMSC" WITH REPLICATION = {'class' : 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 1};
]]>
</screen>    
You should setup the keyspace strategy and the replication factor as required. If the above command is executed successfully, it must not return any error message.  
			</para></step>
			<step><para>
			It is not required for you to create any tables in the keyspace; SMSC will create the tables when started. If the keyspace contains old tables you should remove them prior to starting the SMSC.
			</para></step>
			<step><para>
A new database (keyspace) will be created locally (a single working Cassandra node). It is a Cassandra cluster which has only one node. By adding more nodes, you can make it a multi node cluster.  
			</para></step>
		</procedure>
		<procedure>
		<title>Destroy a Cassandra database (keyspace)</title>
		<step><para>To destroy a Cassandra database (keyspace) you can make use of the <literal>cql</literal> command:
<screen><![CDATA[
DROP KEYSPACE "TelestaxSMSC";
]]>
</screen>
		</para></step>
		<step><para>
Executing the above <literal>cql</literal> command will result in the immediate, irreversible removal of the keyspace 'TelestaxSMSC', including all column families and data contained in the keyspace.
		</para></step>
		</procedure>

		<title>Configuring the Gateway</title>
		<para>
		Now that you have installed &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; to suit your needs, you can go ahead and configure the SS7 Stack and the SMSC Gateway to meet your requirements. The &THIS.PLATFORM; jSS7 Stack Admin Guide in the <filename>telscale-smscgateway-&lt;version&gt;/docs/ss7/</filename> folder will assist you in configuring and managing the SS7 Stack. Only when you have completely configured the SS7 Stack to meet your requirements, you must go ahead with configuring the SMSC Gateway. 
		</para>
		<para>The &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; Admin Guide in the <filename>telscale-smscgateway-&lt;version&gt;/docs/smsc/</filename> folder will assist you in configuring and managing the SMSC Gateway. To configure and manage both the Stack and the Gateway you can use the Command Line Interface (CLI) tool or the GUI Management Console that comes with the platform.
