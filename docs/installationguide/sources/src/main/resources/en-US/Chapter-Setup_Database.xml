&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; stores messages using Cassandra database. The database is used for storing unsent messages, messages successfully sent and messages that failed to be sent. You must have Cassandra database (version 1.2 or higher) installed. We recommend that you use the latest version (1.2.8 is the most recent version yet).
	</para>
	<note><para> &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; uses Cassandra Native Driver and therefore you should enable support for native drivers by setting the value of <literal>start_native_transport</literal> to <literal>true</literal> in the file <filename>apache-cassandra-1.2.8/conf/cassandra.yaml</filename>. Failure to do this may result in the Gateway not starting correctly.</para></note>
