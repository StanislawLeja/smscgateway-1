	<title>Introduction</title>
   <para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is an Open Source Java based SMSC Gateway built on a modern extensible middleware platform. &THIS.PLATFORM; SMSC enables operators to provide core SMSC features like mobile subscriber to subscriber SMS messaging, broadcasting campaigns and group messaging between subscribers. In addition it also enables value added services through integration with OTT social networks and microblogs such as Facebook and Twitter.  
	</para>
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is an easy-to-install and easy-to-deploy platform that can be set up and configured very quickly. Since it is built on a modern and extensible JSLEE platform it automatically provides out-of-the-box integration with various communication protocols such as SIP, Diameter, HTTP, XCAP, XMPP, MGCP and others in addition to the base SMPP protocol for connectivity to ESMEs. 
	</para>
<para>
		&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; is cloud-ready. It can be deployed on dedicated hardware, private cloud infrastructure or public laaS such as AWS. &THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; supports TDM hardware offered by major vendors in the market, namely Intel family boards (Dialogic) and 
		Zaptel/Dahdi (Digium, Sangoma). TeleStax also has in-house SS7 cards also known as TelScale SS7 Cards. TelScale SS7 cards have MTP2/3 support on-board and therefore the processing load on the server hosting the 
		&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION; platform will be low when you use these SS7 cards.    
	</para>

<para>
A single &THIS.PLATFORM; SMSC node can process up to 1000 SMS/sec. Multiple SMSC nodes can be arranged in a cluster across one or more geographically distributed data centers to scale up throughput and provide various levels of redundancy, high availability and fault tolerance.
</para>
	<para>&THIS.PLATFORM; &THIS.APPLICATION;
		is based on the robust and proven &THIS.PLATFORM;
		JAIN SLEE 1.1 Server and &THIS.PLATFORM;
		jSS7 Stack.
	&THIS.PLATFORM;
		JAIN SLEE Server is a highly scalable event-driven application server with a robust component model and fault tolerant execution environment. It provides a set of connectors to a
		variety of networks elements: SS7 MAP, TCAP, INAP, ISUP, SMPP, XMPP, SIP, MGCP, HTTP, XDM, XCAP, Diameter and many others. It is fully compliant with JSR 240 (JSLEE 1.1).
	&THIS.PLATFORM;
		jSS7 is a software based implementation of the SS7 protocol. It provides implementation for Level 2 and above in the SS7 protocol Stack. &THIS.PLATFORM;
		jSS7 Stack User Guide is bundled within and you can refer to the guide for more details on the Stack.
