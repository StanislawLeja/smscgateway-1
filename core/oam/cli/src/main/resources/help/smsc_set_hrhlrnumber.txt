Name
	smsc set hrhlrnumber

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set hrhlrnumber <hlr GT digits>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a pre-configured HLR address for SRI messages.
	
	In some scenarios it may be required to set a HLR address instead of a
	MSISDN address into the SCCP 'CalledPartyAddress' of 'SendRoutingInfo'
	requests issued by the SMSC GW in both mobile terminated and home routing
	modes. In such cases, you must set this parameter 'hrhlrnumber' to a 
	pre-configured HLR address. 
	
	For all other scenarios where this is not required, you may leave this
	parameter empty. When this is empty, the SCCP 'CalledPartyAddress' of 
	'SendRoutingInfo' request will be set to the destination MSISDN of a 
	subscriber.
