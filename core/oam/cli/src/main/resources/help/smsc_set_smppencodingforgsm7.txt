Name
	smsc set smppencodingforgsm7

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set smppencodingforgsm7 <UTF8|UNICODE>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set the SMPP Encoding Scheme for GSM7. SMPP side messages 
	with data coding == 8 [UCS2] accept two different encoding schemes [UTF8 and 
	UNICODE] for both sending and receiving messages. SMSC can be configured to 
	accept for one of them (the one that ESME supports). If this is not set, 
	then the default encoding scheme is UTF8.

EXAMPLES
	smsc set smppencodingforgsm7 utf8 
	or
	smsc set smppencodingforgsm7 unicode
