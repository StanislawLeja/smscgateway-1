SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set autonegotiateversion <true/false>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify if auto-negotiate-version is enabled or not.
	If it is set to 'true' and a Bind is received with version <= 3.3 for 
	interface version, then it is normalized to version 3.3. If a Bind is received 
	with version >= 3.4 for interface version, it is normalized to version 3.4.

	The default value is true.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
