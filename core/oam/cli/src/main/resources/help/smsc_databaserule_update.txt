Name
	smsc databaserule update

SYNOPSIS
	smsc databaserule update <address> <systemId>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to add or update a Database Rule. 

	Database Rules are Rules that are used for routing messages to a proper ESME. 
	
	When you define a rule using the above command, you are creating a routing rule
	that states:
	"If the destination address of a message corresponds with the value specified in
	the 'address' field, then the message be sent to an ESME identified by the value
	specified in the 'systemId' field".

	To add a new rule you must issue the command with only the systemId parameter.

	To update an existing rule, you must issue the command with both the address 
	parameter and the systemId parameter.
