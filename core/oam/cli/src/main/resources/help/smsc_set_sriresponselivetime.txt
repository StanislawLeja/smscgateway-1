Name
	smsc set sriresponselivetime

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set sriresponselivetime <time in seconds>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a SRI responses Cache Time.
	SMSC GW can store successfull SendRoutinInfo (SRI) responses (with IMSI and
	NetworkNodeNumber data) into an internal cach for some configurable time.
	SMSC GW parameter "sriresponselivetime" specifies the minimum time value for
	storing of a response. Caching of SRI responses takes some system resources
	and is recommended only if you need it for some scenarious (like you send
	firstly only an SRI request and do not deliver a message just to understend
	IMSI / NetworkNodeNumber (this scenario is achieavable by mproc rules) and
	then send a message in short time if needed).

EXAMPLES
	smsc set sriresponselivetime 0
