Name
	smsc set duedelaymultiplicator

SYNOPSIS
	smsc set duedelaymultiplicator <due-delay-multiplicator>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to set a value for due-delay-multiplicator. This parameter 
	specifies the delay multiplicator value before another delivery attempt (after 
	failure) is made. 

	After a message delivery failure (if message validity period is not over and the 
	failure is temporary), a delay period is induced before the next delivery attempt.
	This delay period is calculated as follows: 

	Delay after the first delivery failure = 
				second-due-delay

	Delay after every consecutive delivery failure = 
				prev-due-delay * due-delay-multiplicator / 100 
			        where prev-due-delay is the delay at the previous step.

EXAMPLES
	smsc set duedelaymultiplicator 200
