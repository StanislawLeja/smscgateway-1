Name
	smppserver set defaultwindowmonitorinterval

SYNOPSIS
	smppserver set defaultwindowmonitorinterval <default-window-monitor-interval>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to specify the default-window-monitor-interval for the Server 
	in milli-seconds. This is the time between executions of monitoring the window for
	requests that expire. It is recommended that this value, generally, either matches 
	or is half the value of 'request-expiry-timeout'. Therefore, in the worst case
	scenario, a request could take upto 1.5 times the 'requestExpiryTimeout' to 
	clear out.

	The default value is 15000 milli seconds.

	You must restart the SMPP Server for the new value to take effect.
